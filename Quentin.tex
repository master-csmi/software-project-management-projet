    \begin{block}{Use GitHub for XP : Practices}
    GitHub has a lot of tools which can help for the different practices of XP.
        \begin{itemize}
        	\item \textbf{Continous integration :} Work on a separated file, then add it to the project \pause
        	\item \textbf{Small releases :} Every time someone works on a programm, he can send his work easily thanks to commits. \pause
        	 \item \textbf{Refactoring :} You can see all the changes for every commit, so you can easily try to change some code and cancel if needed \pause
        	 \item \textbf{Collective code ownership :} Latest versions are available for each contributor on GitHub. All files are in the same repository, and everyone can work with them. \pause
        	 \item \textbf{Pair programming :} Issues are a good way for two people to communicate on the project
        \end{itemize}
