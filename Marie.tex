    \begin{block}{Communication}
        \One of the values of XP is communication.
        \GitHub is a collective space. You've got a part "project", were you can plan your project, sort tasks...
        \For every change in your work, you have commit to explain to other what you've done.
        \GitHub has Issues. It's work like a chat with your co-workers.

    \begin{block}{Courage} 
        \One of the values of XP is courage.
        \With XP, we've got every oldier version of our work. We can also try huge change (like changing the architectur of the project, suppress some code...) without behing afraid of loosing everything.
