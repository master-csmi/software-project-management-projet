    \begin{block}{Communication}
        GitHub is a collective space. It the part "projet", the user you can plan project, sort tasks... For every change in a work, there is commit to explain to other co-workers what as been changed. There is also Issues. It's work like a chat between the co-workers.
    \end{block}\pause 
    \begin{block}{Courage} 
        With Github, every older version of a work is saved. The collaborators can also try huge change (like changing the architecture of the project, suppress some code...) without being afraid of loosing everything.

    \begin{block}{Simplicity} 
        As every file and every program are saved on GitHub, their latest version are available for everyone at any moment, there's no difficulty to send information or programs. Extreme programming makes program evolve really quick, so every contributor should be able to work on the latest version.
    \end{block}\pause
    \begin{block}{Feedback} 
        The customer and the programmer are both contributors of the project on GitHub. The customer can get the latest version of the project at any moment, test this version, give feedback and ask for modifications through issues (and assign the person working on this part of the project to the issue).
